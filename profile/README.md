# ⭐️ Welcome to 6328's 10th season! ⭐️

FRC 6328 Mechanical Advantage is a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Team based in Littleton, Massachusetts. We are a high school competitive robotics team participating in [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org) programs designed to teach students hands-on, real-world engineering and business skills. As a member of the Open Alliance, we strive to raise the tide for all by sharing our work on Chief Delphi and here on GitHub.
